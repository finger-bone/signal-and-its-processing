# Discrete Calculus

In this chapter, we will introduce fourier transform for discrete signals.

## Discrete Pulse Signal

Similarly, we can define discrete signal. Unlike continuous signal, where pulse signal is a limit of any distribution, discrete signal is just a sequence of 0 and 1.

$$
\delta[n] = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } n = 0 \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Similarly, we use sum instead of integral. So,

$$
u[t] = \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } t < 0 \\
    1 & \text{if } t \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

Where,

$$
u[t] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{t} \delta[n]
$$

## Discrete Convolution

We simply replace the integral with sum,

$$
x[t] \ast y[t] = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} x[n-t] y[n]
$$

## Discrete Calculus

:::tip

Discrete calculus is not a subject that mathematicians study a lot, so there isn't a unified notation or way to do it.

There are more than one ways- wether focused on forward difference, backward difference, shifting forward, backward operator, etc. Using only one of them, we can build up a discrete calculus theory.

For simplicity and convenience, we use both backward difference and shifting backward operators to build our theory.

:::

### Operators

We note the backward shift as,

$$
\mathcal{B}(x[n]) = x[n-1]
$$

And difference (backward) as,

$$
\Delta x[n] = x[n] - x[n - 1]
$$

It's obvious that,

$$
\Delta = 1 - \mathcal{B}
$$

The eigen function of the $\mathcal{B}$  is $z^n$,

$$
\mathcal{B} z^n = \frac{1}{z} z^{n}
$$

And so is true for difference

$$
\Delta z^n = z^n - z^{n-1} = (1 - \frac{1}{z}) z^{n}
$$

The reverse of $\mathcal{B}$ is,

$$
\mathcal{B}^{-1} x[n] = x[n + 1]
$$

That is the moving-forward.

Obviously, they are all linear operators.

### Factorial Power Sequence

There is also an important sequence, the (decrease) factorial power sequence,

$$
x^{\underline{n}} = x \cdot (x - 1) \cdot (x - 2) \cdot \cdots \cdot (x - n + 1)
$$

This is worthy of mentioning here since,

$$
\Delta z^{\underline{n}} =z^{\underline{n}} - z^{\underline{n-1}} \\
= n (z - 1)^{\underline{n - 1}}
$$

Which corresponds to,

$$
Dx^n = nx^{n - 1}
$$

We can factor normal power into factorial power,

$$
z^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \genfrac{\{}{\}}{0pt}{}{n}{k} z^{\underline{k}}
$$

$\genfrac{\{}{\}}{0pt}{}{n}{k}$ is called the stirling number of the second kind.
It satisfies,

$$
\genfrac{\{}{\}}{0pt}{}{n}{k} = \genfrac{\{}{\}}{0pt}{}{n-1}{k-1} + k\genfrac{\{}{\}}{0pt}{}{n-1}{k} \\
\genfrac{\{}{\}}{0pt}{}{0}{m} = 1
$$

You don't need to remember those- we don't dive that deep. You can just have the following common formula,

$$
z^2 = z^{\underline{2}} + z^{\underline{1}} \\
z^3 = z^{\underline{3}} + 3z^{\underline{2}} + z^{\underline{1}} \\
$$

### Product Rule of Difference

Just like derivative, where,

$$
D(uv) = u D v + v D u
$$

We have,

$$
\Delta(x[n] y[n]) = x[n]y[n] - x[n-1]y[n-1] \\
= x[n]y[n] - x[n]y[n-1] + x[n]y[n-1] - x[n-1]y[n-1] \\
= x[n]\Delta y[n] + \mathcal{B} y[n] \Delta x[n]
$$

### Sum

Sum corresponds to the integral.

We define,

$$
X[n] = \sum x[k]
$$

Where,

$$
\Delta X[n] = x[n]
$$

Thus,

$$
X[n] = \Delta^{-1} x[n]
$$

Likewise, adding any constant $C$ won't change this property,

$$
X[n] + C = \sum x[n]
$$

:::tip

Please note that,

$$
\frac{1}{\Delta} n^{\underline{p}} = \frac{1}{p + 1} (n + 1)^{\underline{p + 1}}
$$

:::

In addition, we also have,

$$
X[b] - X[a] = \sum_{a}^{b} x[n] = \sum_{n=a}^{b} x[n] \quad b \geq a
$$

If $b < a$, then we have,

$$
\sum_{a}^{b} x[n] = -\sum_{b}^{a} x[n]
$$

Just like the integral, we have the sum by partition, what we call the Abel summation.

Previous, we concluded,

$$
\Delta(x[n] y[n]) = x[n]\Delta y[n] + \mathcal{B} y[n] \Delta x[n]
$$

$$
\sum_{a}^{b} x[n] \Delta y[n] \\
=\sum_{a}^{b} (\Delta(x[n]y[n]) - \mathcal{B} y[n] \Delta x[n]) \\
= (x[n]y[n])|_{a}^{b} - \sum_{a}^{b} \mathcal{B} y[n] \Delta x[n] \\
$$

That equals to say,

$$
\sum x[n]\Delta y[n] = x[n]y[n] - \sum \mathcal{B} y[n] \Delta x[n]
$$

For example, if we want,

$$
Y[n] = \sum_{0}^{n} z^2 2^z
$$

If you never learnt discrete calculus, it'd take some trick to get the result. But we can do it with brute force now,

$$
\sum z^2 2^z \\
= \sum z^2 (2^{z+1} - 2^{z}) \\
= \sum z^2 \Delta 2^{z+1} \\
= z^2 2^{z+1} - \sum 2^z \Delta z^2 \\
= z^2 2^{z+1} - \sum 2^z (2z - 1) \\
= z^2 2^{z+1} - \sum (2z - 1) \Delta 2^{z+1} \\
= 2^{z+1}(z^2 - 2z + 1) + \sum 2^{z + 1} \\
= 2^{z+1}(z^2 - 2z + 3)
$$

Thus,

$$
Y[n] = 2^{n+1}(n^2 - 2n + 3) + C \\
Y[0] = 6 + C = 0
$$

So,

$$
Y[n] = 2^{n+1}(n^2 - 2n + 3) - 6
$$

:::info

Other methods to calculate the sum includes,

Using shift-and-subtract method, that is,

$$
Y[n] - 2Y[n] = - z^2 2^{z+1} + \sum_{1}^{n} (z^2 - (z - 1)^2) 2^{z}
$$

And repeat it. This is just using Abel summation indirectly.

Another trick is using z-transformation, a transform introduced alter. This trick equals to the method of generation function.
