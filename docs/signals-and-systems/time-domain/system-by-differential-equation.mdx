# System by Differential Equation

Previously we introduced the properties of signals and systems in the time domain. Here we focus on a common case, where a system is defined by a differential equation and how can we solve them.

We use $D$ as the differential operator for convenience.

TLI system is always defined as a linear differential equation, that is,

$$
y(t) = \mathcal{S}(x(t))
$$

$$
P(D)y(t) = x(t)
$$

Where $P(D)$ is a polynomial of operator $D$. For convenience, we force the constant term to exists. Or else, we can always integrate the both side to get an equivalent equation with our desired $P(D)$.

We can usually solve this easily with the following method for common inputs,

## Eigen Decomposition

We decompose the result $y(t)$ we are looking for into two parts,

$$
y(t) = \overline{y}(t) + y^*(t)
$$

Where,

$$
P(D)\overline{y}(t) =0
$$

Called the eigen solution.

And,

$$
P(D)y^*(t) = x(t)
$$

Called the special solution.

### Eigen Solution

Let's first look for,

$$
P(D)\overline{y}(t) = 0
$$

If we take,

$$
L(D) = P(D) - \mu
$$

Where $\mu$ is the coefficient of the zeroth order term in $P$, then,

$$
L(D)\overline{y}(t) = \mu \overline{y}(t)
$$

That is equal to say we should look for the eigen function of $L(D)$.

:::info

The deduction done below is no where rigorous.

:::

Let's use,

$$
P(D)\overline{y}(t)=0
$$

Because it is easier to solve.

We can decompose $P(D)$ into,

$$
P(D) = \prod_{i=0}^{i=m} (D-a_i)^{p_i}
$$

So long that any of the factor results in zero after applying to a function, we can have the eigen function.

For,

$$
(D-a_i)^{p_i} y_i(t) = 0
$$

If,

$$
p_i = 1
$$

Then obviously,

$$
y_i(t) = A_i \exp(a_i t)
$$

For,

$$
p_i \geq 2
$$

It is,

$$
y_i(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{j=p_i-1} A_{ij} x^j \exp(a_i t)
$$

So when can have,

$$
\overline{y}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{i=m} y_i(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{i=m} \sum_{j=0}^{j=p_i-1} A_{ij} x^j \exp(a_i t)
$$

### Special Solution

Now we want,

$$
P(D)y^*(t) = x(t)
$$

We need to look for,

$$
P(D)^{-1}x(t)
$$

Because we can always use Taylor expansion to make,

$$
P(D)^{-1} = P'(D)
$$

So formally,

$$
y(t) = P'(D)x(t)
$$

But $P'(D)$ has infinite terms, so this is actually hard to solve.

But if $x(t)$ is only a polynomial of $t$ with the highest order of $n$, we can truncate $P'(D)$ to order $n$, so that it is easy to solve.

However, if there exists $e^{at}$ in $x(t)$, truncate can't be done. But we can use the following of what we call the shifting theorem,

Because,

$$
D(e^{at} x(t)) = (D+a)e^{at}x(t)
$$

So we can conclude,

$$
P(D) e^{at}x(t) = e^{at}P(D+a)x(t)
$$

This is the shifting theorem.

### Example

Let's solve,

$$
(D + 1)^2(D-1) y(t) = e^{-at}t
$$

We can have,

$$
\overline{y}(t) = Ae^{t} + (B + Ct) e^{-t}
$$

Then we look after,

$$
y^*(t) = \frac{1}{(D+1)^2(D-1)}e^{-at}t
$$

We apply the shifting theorem,

$$
y^*(t) = e^{-at} \frac{1}{(D-a+1)^2(D-a-1)}t
$$

We can do some simplification,


$$
y^*(t) = e^{-at} \frac{1}{(D-a+1)^2(D-a-1)}t \\
= e^{-at} \frac{(D-a+1)-(D-a-1)}{2(D-a+1)^2(D-a-1)}t \\
= e^{-at} (\frac{1}{2(D-a+1)(D-a-1)} - \frac{1}{2(D-a+1)^2}) t \\
= \frac{1}{2} e^{-at} (\frac{1}{D^2-2aD+a^2-1} - \frac{1}{D^2 - 2(a-1)D + (a-1)^2}) t
$$

Consider,

$$
\frac{1}{D^2-2aD+a^2-1}
$$

We can use the polynomial devision, that is,

$$
\frac{1}{D^2-2aD+a^2-1} \\
= \frac{\frac{1}{a^2-1}(D^2-2aD+a^2-1) - \frac{D^2-2aD}{a^2-1}}{D^2-2aD+a^2-1} \\
= \frac{1}{a^2 -1} -D\frac{-2a + D}{(D^2-2aD+a^2-1)(a^2 -1)} \\
= \frac{1}{a^2 -1} - D\frac{\frac{-2a}{a^2-1}(D^2-2aD+a^2-1) - (1 - \frac{4a^2}{a^2-1})D + \frac{2a}{a^2-1}D^2}{(D^2-2aD+a^2-1)(a^2 -1)} \\
= \frac{1}{a^2 - 1} + \frac{2a}{(a^2-1)^2}D + D^2\frac{\frac{2a}{a^2-1}D + \frac{4a^2}{a^2 - 1}-1}{(D^2-2aD+a^2-1)(a^2 -1)}
$$

Because as we expand further, the order will be higher than $D^2$, but $D^2 t = 0$, so we can truncate the result.

Similarly,

$$
\frac{1}{D^2 - 2(a-1)D + (a-1)^2} = \frac{1}{(a-1)^2} + \frac{2}{(a-1)^3}D + D^2 R(D)
$$

Let's go back to,

$$
y^*(t) = \frac{1}{2} e^{-at} (\frac{1}{D^2-2aD+a^2-1} - \frac{1}{D^2 - 2(a-1)D + (a-1)^2}) t \\
= \frac{e^{-at}}{2}(\frac{1}{a^2 - 1}t + \frac{2a}{(a^2-1)^2} + \frac{1}{(a-1)^2}t + \frac{2}{(a-1)^3})
$$

So we have the solution,

$$
y(t) = y^*(t)+\overline{y}(t)
$$

## Differential Equation with Pulse signals

### Integration Example

The previous method is very nice. However, when come to equations like,

$$
P(D)y(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{+\infty} A_i D^{i} \delta(t) + u(t) s(t)
$$

Of course, we can solve this by parts with the previous method. That is, we can solve,

$$
P(D)y(t) = s(t) \quad t > 0 \\
P(D)y(t) = 0 \quad t < 0
$$

Instead.

This seems to have solved the issue. But we will have multiple sets of solutions and undefined coefficients- but according to the theory, we should only need one initial state.

We illustrate this by,

$$
Dy + y = \delta(t) + u(t)
$$

For $t > 0$,

$$
y = Ae^{-t} + 1
$$

For $t < 0$,

$$
y = (B-A)e^{-t}
$$

However, since this equation is one order, the following initial state,

$$
y(-0) = 4
$$

Should give us a complete solution- but we have two coefficients here.

This is because, $A$ and $B$ are not independent of each other.

We can rewrite the above solution into one with step function,

$$
y(t) = (A + Bu(t))e^{-t} + u(t)
$$

Let's consider have the differential equation behaves around $0$.

$$
Dy + y = \delta(t) + u(t)
$$

We integrate on the both sides from $-\epsilon$ to $\epsilon$,

$$
\int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} (Dy+y) \mathrm{d}t = \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} (\delta(t) + u(t)) \mathrm{d}t
$$

$$
y(\epsilon) - y(-\epsilon) + \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} y(t) \mathrm{d}t = \int_{-\epsilon}^{\epsilon} (\delta(t) + u(t)) \mathrm{d}t
$$

We make $\epsilon \to 0$, so,

$$
y(+0) - y(-0) = 1
$$

That is to say,

$$
y(-0) = 4 \quad y(+0) = 5
$$

Now we can have,

$$
A = 4 \quad A+B+1 = 5
$$

Now we can solve $A$ and $B$.

This is how we can solve differential equation with pulse signals.

Similarly, for equations of higher order, there will be $y^{(n)}(+0) - y^{(n)}(-0)$ as well.

You can always analyze by integration, the method above is too grinding- we have a better trick called pulse balancing.

### Pulse Balancing

Let's consider the differential equation,

$$
P(D)y(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{+\infty} A_i D^{i} \delta(t) + Cu(t) + s(t)
$$

What results in the jump value? It is the discontinuous part of the right side, that is, all $\delta(t)$ related function and $Cu(t)$.

:::tip

Why discontinuous part on the right side causes jump value? We can integrate on the both sides, just like before.

:::

We can always consider moving the right side to into the $y(t)$, that is,

$$
P(D)(y(t) - \sum_{i=0}^{+\infty} A'_i D^{i} \delta(t) - C'u(t)) = s(t)
$$

If $s(t)$ is continuous, then $y(t) - \sum_{i=0}^{+\infty} A'_i D^{i} \delta(t) - C'u(t)$ is continuous. Because the $\sum_{i=0}^{+\infty} A'_i D^{i} \delta(t) + C'u(t)$ part is discontinuous, and so is $y(t)$, their jump value must be the same so that they can be deduced. So we can just integrate $\sum_{i=0}^{+\infty} A'_i D^{i} \delta(t) + C'u(t)$ for the jump value- and better off, the integration is easy. For the zeroth order, it is obvious $C'$, for the $i$ th order, it is, $(i)!A'_{i-1}$.

This is kind of abstract- let's demonstrate with an example,

### Example

Let's solve,

$$
D^2y+4Dy+3y = \delta'(t) + \delta(t) + u(t)
$$

And,

$$
y(-0) = 2 \quad y'(-0) = 2
$$

We first calculate the solution by parts.

$$
y(t) = (A+Bu(t))e^{-3t} + (C + Du(t))e^{-t} + u(t)
$$

Now let's calculate the jump values. We want to find,

$$
P(D)(y(t) - \sum_{i=0}^{+\infty} A'_i D^{i} \delta(t) - C'u(t)) = s(t)
$$

Obviously, the highest derivate from $\delta'(t)$ should be a result from the highest term on the left side, that is, we can conclude that,

$$
D^2(y-u(t))+4D(y-u(t))+3(y-u(t)) = -3\delta(t) - 2u(t)
$$

Then repeat for $-3\delta(t)$,

$$
D^2(y-u(t)+3tu(t))+4D(y-u(t)+3tu(t))+3(y-u(t)+3tu(t)) = 14u(t) + 9tu(t)
$$

Finally, the $u(t)$ terms,

$$
D^2(y-u(t)+3tu(t)-14\frac{1}{2}t^2u(t))+\\4D(y-u(t)+3tu(t)-14\frac{1}{2}t^2u(t))+\\3(y-u(t)+3tu(t)-14\frac{1}{2}t^2u(t)) = 9tu(t) - 28tu(t) - 21t^2u(t)
$$

Now that the right side is continuous, we can conclude,

$$
y_c(t) = y-u(t)+3tu(t)-14\frac{1}{2}t^2u(t)
$$

is continuous.

So we have,

$$
y(+0)-y(-0) = 1
$$ 

Then we calculate the derivate,

$$
y_c'(t) = y'(t) - \delta(t)+3u(t)+14tu(t)
$$

So,

$$
y'(+0)-y'(-0) = -3
$$

We can add these equations for the final result.

Please note that the solution does not actually preserve how the $y$ behaves at $0$, but we don't really care about how infinite a infinite value at $0$ should be, so it's okay.

Now we can solve the respond function. For any system described by differential equation.
