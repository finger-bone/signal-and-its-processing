# Signal Time Domain Properties

## Casual Signal

If a signal is only non-zero for $t \geq 0$, it is called a casual signal.

## Periodic Signal

If,

$$
f(t) = f(t + T)
$$

Where $T$ is the minimum positive number that makes this true.

Then $f(t)$ is periodic with $T$.

:::info

For common signals like,

$$
f(t) = Re(e^{j\omega t})
$$

Obviously, the period is $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$.

However, consider the discrete signal,

$$
f[t] = Re(e^{j\omega t})
$$

Let's solve,

$$
\omega T = 2\pi k
$$

The $T$ doesn't guarantee to be $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$. This is because in discrete signal, the minimum value of $T$ is one instead of zero.

To solve the equation, obvious, $\omega$ must be a rational scale of $2\pi$, thus assum,

$$
\omega = 2\pi \frac{p}{q}
$$

Where $gcd(p, q) = 1$.

Thus,

$$
T = \frac{qk}{p}
$$

So,

$$
T = q
$$

It is important to note that higher $\omega$ doesn't imply shorter $T$ for discrete signals.

## Energy

The energy of a signal is defined as,

$$
E = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(t)^2 \mathrm{d}t
$$

If the energy of a signal exists, it is called a energetic signal.

## Power

The power of a signal is defined as,

$$
P = \lim_{T \to +\infty} \frac{1}{2T} \int_{-T}^{+T} f(t)^2 \mathrm{d}t
$$

If the power of a signal exists, it is called a power signal.
