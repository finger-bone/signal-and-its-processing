# System in Frequency Domain

Now let's talk about systems.

## System Response Function in Frequency Domain

Previously, we know that all LTI system can be described in the time domain with convolution.

$$
y(t) = x(t) \ast h(t)
$$

We can take this into frequency domain, we get,

$$
Y(\omega) = X(\omega) H(\omega)
$$

Here, $H(\omega)$ is called the system response function in frequency domain. It is the fourier transform of the impulse response of the system.

## Solving System in Differential Equation by Fourier Transform

Now let's consider solving a LTI system described in differential equation.

$$
P(D)y(t) = x(t)
$$

Obviously, if we apply fourier transform,

$$
P(-j\omega)Y(\omega) = X(\omega)
$$

So the system response function is,

$$
H(\omega) = \frac{1}{P(-j\omega)}
$$

### Example

$$
D^2y+4Dy+3y = x(t)
$$

We apply fourier transform on both sides,

$$
(-\omega^2 - 4j\omega +3)Y(\omega) = X(\omega)
$$

So the system response function is,

$$
H(\omega) = \frac{1}{(3 - j\omega)(1 - j\omega)} \\
= \frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{1 - j\omega} - \frac{1}{3 - j\omega})
$$

Now, we can know that the impulse response of this system is,

$$
h(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(\omega))
$$

Because we know that,

$$
e^{-\alpha t}u(t) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} \frac{1}{j\omega + \alpha}
$$

Thus,

$$
e^{t}u(t) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} \frac{1}{j\omega - 1}
$$

And,

$$
e^{3t}u(t) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} \frac{1}{j\omega - 3}
$$

Due to the linearity of fourier transform, we can get,

$$
\mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(\omega)) = -\frac{1}{2}(e^{t} - e^{3t})u(t)
$$

However, you can tell that we still need to calculate the jump value. This issue will be solved with laplace transform.
