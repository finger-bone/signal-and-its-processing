# Discrete System in Time Domain

We previously defined convolution for discrete signals as,

$$
x[n] \ast y[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} x[m] y[n - m]
$$

We previous learned that,

$$
x(t) = x(t) \ast \delta(t)
$$

Similarly, it's obvious,

$$
x[n] = x[n] \ast \delta[n]
$$

For LTI system, we still have response of unit impulse,

$$
h[n] = \mathcal{S}(\delta[n])
$$

And, because of linearity,

$$
y[n] = h[n] \ast x[n]
$$
