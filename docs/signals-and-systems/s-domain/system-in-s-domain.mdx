# System in S Domain

We will say how Laplace transform solves the issue of jump value. But before that, we need some trivial work done.

## System Response Function in S Domain

Because fourier transform and laplace transform follows the same rule of convolution, and LTI system can always be described by the system impulse response, that is,

$$
y(t) = x(t) \ast h(t)
$$

Just like how we did with fourier transformation, we can use,

$$
Y(s) = X(s)H(s)
$$

$H(s)$ is the system response function in s domain.

## Solving System in Differential Equation by Laplace Transform

To describe this part in a more general way is hard. So let's only look at a system described by a differential equation of the second order. What we are introducing is valid for higher orders, it's just more complex.

$$
(aD^2+bD+c)y = x
$$

Now let's apply laplace transform. Please note that, for laplace transform, the derivative will result in an extra term.

Since,

$$
Df \xrightarrow{\mathcal{L}} s L(s) - f(-0)
$$

Thus,

$$
D^2f = DDf \\
\xrightarrow{\mathcal{L}} s(sL(s) - f(-0)) - f'(-0) \\
= s^2 L(s) - sf(-0) - f'(-0)
$$

Put this into the original equation,

$$
as^2 Y(s) - asf(-0) - af'(-0) + b s Y(s) - bf(-0) + c Y(s) = X(s)
$$

Let's group them,

$$
(as^2 + bs + c) Y(s) = X(s) + asf(-0) + af'(-0) + bf(-0)
$$

We can tell that the right hand side is made up of two parts,

$X(s)$ is the external input. Where as $asf(-0) + a'f(-0) + bf(-0)$ is caused by internal state.

We treat both the external input and the internal state as the input of the system, so we can write,

$$
H(s) = \frac{1}{as^2 +bs+c}
$$

Due to the linearity, the solution is also in two parts,

$$
Y_{0s}(s) = \frac{X(s)}{as^2 +bs+c} \\
Y_{0i}(s) = \frac{asf(-0) + af'(-0) + bf(-0)}{as^2 +bs+c}
$$

The $Y_{0s}(s)$ is the zero state response. Because it presumes $f^{(n)}(-0) = 0$.

The $Y_{0i}(s)$ is the zero input response. Because it presumes $Y(s) = 0$.

The final $Y(s) = Y_{0s}(s) + Y_{0i}(s)$. To get the time domain result, we simply perform a reverse laplace transform.

Please note that this solution is only dependent on $f^{(n)}(-0)$. And thus there is no need to calculate the jump value.

In addition, please note the fact that,

$$
Y(s) = Y_{0s}(s) + Y_{0i}(s)
$$

Is only valid for $t > -0$. We can't have any information for $t < -0$ because we use single side laplace transform. If we want the convergence of the single side, we lose half of the solution.

:::info

You can also do this separation in the time domain. It is just that it's not obvious.

For a differential equation,

$$
P(D)y(t) = x(t)
$$

With initial values, $y^{(n)}(-0)$ given.

If we presume $x(t) = 0$, the solution is the zero input response in the time domain, which is in pair with the zero input response in s domain. And vice versa for zero state response solved by letting $y^{(n)}(-0)=0$ instead of the given values.

In the end, the solution is the sum of the two solutions.

$$
y(t) = y_{0s}(t) + y_{0i}(t)
$$

:::

However, please note that, because we used single side laplace transformation, we can only solve the response from $-0$ to $+\infty$. So we have only $y(t)$ on the positive side.

### Example

If we choose,

$$
a = 1 \quad  b = 4 \quad c = 3 \quad f(-0) = 1 \quad f'(-0) =1 \quad x(t) = \delta(t) + u(t)
$$

We will have,

$$
X(s) = 1 + \frac{1}{s}
$$

Thus, for the zero state response,

$$
Y_{0s}(s) = \frac{1+\frac{1}{s}}{s^2 +4s+3} \\
= \frac{s+1}{(s+3)(s+1)s} \\
= \frac{1}{(s+3)(s+1)} \\
= \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{s+1} - \frac{1}{s+3})
$$

Because,

$$
e^{-at} \xrightarrow{\mathcal{L}} \frac{1}{s+a}
$$

Thus, for the positive time,

$$
y_{0s}(t) = \frac{1}{2}(e^{-t} - e^{-3t})
$$

And for the zero input response,

$$
Y_{0i} = \frac{s+5}{s^2 + 4s + 3} \\
= \frac{s+5}{(s+3)(s+1)} \\
= \frac{2}{s+1} - \frac{1}{s+3}
$$

So,

$$
y_{0i} = 2 e^{-t} - e^{-3t}
$$

This is why laplace transform doesn't need a jump value- we only need the information at $-0$.
