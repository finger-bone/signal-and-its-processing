# Discrete Fourier Transform

There are actually two types of discrete time fourier transform, discrete fourier transform (DFT) and discrete time fourier transform (DTFT).

The former is in fact the fourier series for a discrete signal. The latter is the fourier transform on a discrete signal. We introduce DFT first.

## DFT

Again, DFT is a fourier series, just called discrete fourier transform.

For continuous, periodic signal, we had,

$$
x(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k e^{j k \omega t}
$$

$$
a_k = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} x(t) e^{-j k \omega t} \mathrm{d}t
$$

The discrete signal is equal to,

$$
x_s(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{N - 1} x[k] \delta(t - k)
$$

So,

$$
a_k = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} x_s(t) e^{-j k \omega t} \mathrm{d}t = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{k=0}^{N - 1} x[k] e^{-j k \omega t}
$$

Sometimes, we may process signals with a given range (image, for example). Assume it has a rang from $0$ to $N$, we can treat it as a signal with a period of $N$ as well.

We note,

$$
X[k] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N - 1} x[k] e^{-j k \omega t}
$$

As the discrete fourier transform.

However we are not done yet, consider,

$$
x[t] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k e^{j k \omega t}
$$

We would notice that,

$$
X[k + N] = \sum_{k=0}^{N} x[k] e^{-j \omega (k + N) t} \\
= e^{-j \omega N t } \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k e^{j k \omega t}
$$

So $X[k]$ is periodic as well, thus, $x[t]$ after the inverse transform is like not to converge.

The reason is that, consider the discrete complex exponential, we want the period of $N$ and so,

$$
e^{j \omega N} = 1
$$

There exists $N$ if and only if $\omega = 2\pi \frac{p}{q}$, suppose $p$ and $q$ have no common divisor, and thus,

$$
N = \min_k k \frac{q}{p} = q
$$

Which is to say that, the period is only related to the denominator. So it's obvious that, for,

$$
x[t] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} a_k e^{j k \frac{2\pi}{N} t}
$$

If we sum over $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, we are repeating the same base signal over and over again.

We only need to sum each signal once, and so,

$$
x[t] = \sum_{k=0}^{N - 1} a_k e^{j k \frac{2\pi}{N} t}
$$

Is the legit result.

In conclusion, we had,

$$
x[t] = \sum_{k=0}^{N - 1} X[k] e^{j k \frac{2\pi}{N} t} \\
X[k] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N - 1} x[k] e^{-j k \omega t}
$$

However, for correspondence, because we had $\frac{1}{2 \pi}$ for the fourier inverse transform, and thus, we usually use the following form of DFT,

$$
x[t] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N - 1} X[k] e^{j k \frac{2\pi}{N} t} \\
X[k] = \sum_{t=0}^{N - 1} x[t] e^{-j k \frac{2\pi}{N} t}
$$

The two are identical.

This will also come in handy in the next chapter where we need to push $X[k]$ to a continuous limit, and thus, we need a density divider for $x[t]$.
